# TAM

**TAM** (Tiny Assessment Model) is an **experimental R package** for fitting ageâ€“structured stock assessment models using [RTMB](https://github.com/kaskr/RTMB).
It is designed to be **flexible, modular, and lightweight**, making it easy to experiment with different model structures and process assumptions.

## Current Status

* **Highly experimental**: not yet validated for applied stock assessment.
* **Intended for testing ideas** rather than operational advice.
* **Expect breaking changes** as the package evolves.
